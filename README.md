# Simple Graph App
This is a simple tkinter Python application which purpose is to demonstrate a few graph algorithms I have learned.
## Installation
All you need to do is to have Python interpreter and tkinter module installed. Tkinter can be installed using command:

`pip3 install tk`

After that just execute the `main.py` file and tkinter window will open.
## Usage
Add graph nodes by left-clicking anywhere on the canvas. Connect nodes by selecting two nodes with right-click.
## Functions
- **Components** - colors all components of a graph with different color
- **Shortest path** - color the shortest path between two nodes (if path exists)
- **Skeleton** - colors the skeleton of a graph
